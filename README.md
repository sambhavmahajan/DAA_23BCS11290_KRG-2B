# DAA Lab Experiments

This repo contains my **Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA)** lab experiments.  
Each experiment is in its own folder with:  
- `main.cpp` → accepted solution code (from GFG submissions)  
- `submission.png` (or `submission1.png`, `submission2.png`, …) as proof of submission  

## Please dont clone this repository, i have no idea what was even the point of creating such repository
